Here's a hot take:

## My fellow teachers should work as programmers on the side

During my first year of teaching Computer Science to datamatiker students, I've
freelanced part-time as a software developer. I transitioned from my former job
as a firmware developer by freelancing a couple of days per week.

I initially did so because I wanted to save extra money before my wife gave
birth.

But having maintained this workload for a year, I would not be without it.

## It keeps me sharp

I don't have to question if what I teach still applies.

Or if I'm actually still a good programmer.

A lot of what I learned in school about software development practices, I have
never seen in my 20 years of coding for money. I've worked in companies with 3
people, and with 1000 people. I don't think teachers always know if what they
teach applies to the real world. It doesn't have to.

I don't think as fast anymore. I am a lot more structured, though. But there is
a tipping point at which I should recognize that I've lost my marbles. This
responsibility should not rest with my students.

## It provides a more realistic take on AI use

As a working programmer you have a reason to experiment with use of AI. As a
programming teacher you can also use AI for generating teaching material. But
your stance on AI is disconnected from the students: You don't write code
unless it's for teaching, which means you don't explore using AI in the context
of learning anything yourself.

As a working programmer and AI user, I am only disconnected from my students by
experience. When I choose to work on domains and paradigms that are new to me
(e.g. Nix) I'm forced to consider how to deal with AI hallucinations in the
same way as my students.
