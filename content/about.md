# About this blog

Hello. My name is Simon Shine, and I'm a computer programmer from 1985.

I am also a Computer Science teacher at [Erhvervsakademi KÃ¸benhavn][ek], the
largest business academy in Copenhagen. I teach computer programming and basic
Computer Science concepts to students of the Danish datamatiker study
programme, a 2.5 year study programme focusing on hands-on software
development. I have been a teacher there since 2024. Prior to that I spent many
years as a teaching assistant at [DIKU][diku], the Department of Computer Science at
University of Copenhagen, rather than completing my degree.

## Why did I become a Computer Science teacher?

The least controversial reason is that my father was also a teacher.

But since I have vowed to not be like him in all ways, becoming a teacher was
also a choice. I first had the chance on my 2nd year of university when there
was a shortage of 1st semester programming teaching assistants. I didn't apply
because I felt students were better off with more senior students. But I had
got a top grade, and functional programming was my favorite subject by then,
so the professor took a chance and made me responsible for facilitating
classroom exercise sessions. I never had a more successful run than my first,
because I had to compensate for lack of teaching experience with effort, and
I wasn't far from having just taken the class myself.

Having been a teaching assistant throughout and beyond my university time
shaped me a lot:
- Facilitating a classroom is a great motivator to show up on time.
- Presenting something in front of people is a great motivator to learn.
- You're not supposed to know everything, you're supposed to demonstrate learning.

Teaching university students who were often much smarter than myself, and
sometimes much better than me at the taught subjects prior to their first
class, created a sense of humility that has also shaped me since: I cannot
guarantee to be the best at what I teach, or even the best teacher in the
classroom, but I can, without much competition, be the most transparent
learner.

## Why work as a teacher at this point in life?

I had planned to retire as a teacher, so why now?

The short version is: Because I became a father, and I wanted a less stressful
job. I am prone to workaholism, and my wife being Chinese tolerates this quite
a lot. So in order to be present in my son's life early on, I wanted to create
an atmosphere for myself where overworking was not requested or compensated.

Teachers at my school are kind, work-life balanced (and eccentric) people, and
I don't experience competitive behavior, which in turn keeps me from derailing
into all-nighters. They're also often very emotional, but that is nice for a
change having worked a decade in the engine rooms.

## Why teach at a business academy?

Why not at university?

I was a teaching assistant on-and-off for 7 years at DIKU.

I eventually left because I needed to prove my worth as a programmer. Teaching
is the most rewarding job I've had, but the university was the worst employer
I've had. At one point they fired me (and a bunch of other teaching assistants)
due to a nonsensical technical error. I decided that was my cue and have since
explored professional programming.

Coming back to become a teacher at a lower educational level, I have to answer
this question because some colleagues at my school asked me at a Christmas
party: Why are you even working here? with the connotation that I could be
doing much more ambitious things. And "Because I became a dad" rang true to
them: Parenthood and retirement are common reasons to become a teacher.

I chose to teach computer programming at a school that provides a healthy
working environment.

I don't mind that proper scientific research is not part of my job description.

But hearing myself fall into this stereotype, I have to give the realest
reason:

## Because I love computer programming

I really like it. It is my biggest hobby and, until 2020, my only sustained,
intellectual hobby. (I study Chinese now, too.) Computer programming completely
swallowed my life and defined who I am from the age of 11 and until now. I want
to share that joy with people.

Computer programming is one of the few addictions I can recommend, because you
can start by playing with the computer by yourself and progress to become
proficient, and your work may become useful and valuable. Even if you only ever
do it for your own sake, it is worth spending your life on.

You don't need to become a biology researcher to appreciate nature, and you
don't need to become an academic researcher just because Computer Science
contains the word "Science".

Being a professional computer programmer (in Denmark, at least) can provide you
with a great deal of personal freedom in your work.

Teaching students at the university is easier: You don't really have to do as
much, average students are committed to their own learning, and you can get
much farther into advanced subjects that are more fun to explore as a teacher.
So you can feel more accomplished in your teaching because university students
are just more ambitious.

But teaching datamatiker students is heartwarming: Datamatiker students know
they're going to become professional programmers, and they've opted out of
university for whatever reason. I'm here to give them whatever will make them
the best programmers they can be.

I'm not done with professional programming: I haven't created a company, an
outstanding open-source project, my own general-purpose programming language,
or my life's work.

But for now I'm a Computer Science teacher again.

I hope I will get tired of it before I retire.
